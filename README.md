Netscaler Azure templates
--------------------------------------

**Introduction**
----------------

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Citrix Netscaler Azure templates for deploying Netscaler in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. All of the templates in this repository have been developed by the Netscaler engineering team. There are two main directories: Supported and Experimental

**Supported:**
The Supported directory has Netscaler Azure templates that have been created and fully tested by the Citrix team. Should you run into any issues while using these templates, you can get from Citrix Technical Support teams through standard procedures.

**Experimental:**
The Experimental directory has Azure templates that have not yet completed full testing and are subject to change. Citrix does not provide technical support for templates in this directory. Caution is advised while using these templates.
